# Commuter Sim
This is a simple Commuter Simulator that I built to demonstrate basic functions of the HotChocolate GraphQL library in C#. It features full query, mutation, and subscription functionality but focuses on subscriptions. It specifically focuses on subscriptions to server-side events and property changes.
